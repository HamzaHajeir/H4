# Release Notes v1.0.1

## Introduction

A Major version number milestone, reflecting the continued stability of the library, however the changes are minor.

Summary:
* Internal "locking" now by RTOS mutex on ESP32 to prevent problems with multiple cores
* New utility function `stringIsAlpha` to assist with release of [H4Plugins 1.0.1](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins)
* Default Q size reduced to 5
* STM32 deprecated and will probably be removed at next major release
* New [example sketch](examples/chunky_maths/chunky_maths.ino) added to demonstrate advanced chunking / partials
