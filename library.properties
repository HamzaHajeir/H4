sentence=Cross-platform functional scheduler / timer 
paragraph=Multi-Platform asynchronous callback manager allowing invocation of: bare functions, class functions, lambda functions. Greatly simplifies timing, sequencing. Think of javascript promises, observables, asyncy/await functionality for C++ in a minimal footprint ideal for embedded systems. For pure Arduino fans, think "Ticker library on steroids". ESP8266, ESP32, STM32F/0/1/3/4, NUCLEO-F*, Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu + any other Linux that supports C++ standard library
